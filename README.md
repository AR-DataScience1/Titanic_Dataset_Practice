# Titanic_Dataset_Practice
Descriptive Analysis practice on the Titanic dataset.
## About the project 
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. 

On April 15,1912, the RMS Titanic sank while on her first voyage after colliding with an iceberg. The Titanic was considered an engineering marvel and widely regarded as unsinkable. This complacency might have been one of the reasons why there were not enough lifeboats on the ship. As a result of this there were a lot of casualties.  

The titanic.csv dataset contains passenger information along with the information that whether they survived or died in the accident. In this report I have analyzed 3 of these factors and tried to see their correlation with the survival rate. The 3 factors analyzed in this report are: 

1 - Pclass 

2 - Sex 

3 - Age
